# COBIT 2019 — Comprehensive Reference

## Overview

**COBIT** (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) **2019** is ISACA's enterprise IT governance and management framework. It provides a comprehensive structure for organizations to govern and manage enterprise information and technology (I&T), ensuring that IT delivers value, risk is managed, and resources are optimized. COBIT 2019 is framework-agnostic and designed to coexist with other standards (ISO 27001, NIST, ITIL, TOGAF).

## Governance System Principles

COBIT 2019 defines six principles for an enterprise governance system:

| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Provide Stakeholder Value** | The governance system exists to create value for stakeholders by maintaining a balance between benefit realization, risk optimization, and resource optimization. |
| 2 | **Holistic Approach** | Governance relies on a number of components that work together holistically. Each component interacts with and depends on other components. |
| 3 | **Dynamic Governance System** | The governance system should be responsive to changes in the enterprise environment, adjusting design factors and their effects on the governance system. |
| 4 | **Governance Distinct from Management** | Governance evaluates, directs, and monitors; management plans, builds, runs, and monitors. Different organizational structures and purposes. |
| 5 | **Tailored to Enterprise Needs** | The governance system should be customized using design factors as parameters to contextualize governance system components. |
| 6 | **End-to-End Governance System** | Governance covers the full enterprise, not just IT functions. Enterprise I&T encompasses all technology and information processing. |

## Domains and Governance/Management Objectives

### EDM — Evaluate, Direct and Monitor (Governance)

The EDM domain contains the governance objectives. The governing body (board of directors) evaluates strategic options, directs senior management on agreed-upon strategies, and monitors compliance and performance.

| MEA04 | Managed Assurance |

## Capability Levels (Performance Management)

COBIT 2019 uses a CMMI-based capability model to assess the maturity of each governance/management objective. Each objective is rated on a scale from 0 to 5.

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | **Incomplete** | The process is not implemented or fails to achieve its purpose. Little or no evidence of any systematic achievement. |
| 1 | **Performed** | The process achieves its purpose but is not necessarily well-managed. There is evidence of intent to perform and achievement of the objective. |
| 2 | **Managed** | The process is planned, monitored, and adjusted. Work products are established, controlled, and maintained. |
| 3 | **Established** | The process follows a defined, documented standard process. Resources and infrastructure are in place to support the process. |
| 4 | **Predictable** | The process operates within defined quantitative limits. Statistical and other quantitative techniques are used to control and predict outcomes. |
| 5 | **Optimizing** | The process is continuously improved to meet current and projected business goals. Innovation and optimization are systematic. |

**Assessment approach**: Organizations assess each of the 40 objectives against these levels. The target capability level is determined during governance system design (using design factors), not assumed to be Level 5 for all objectives. A typical enterprise targets Level 3 for most objectives, with Level 4-5 reserved for strategically critical processes.

## Design Factors

Design factors are parameters that influence the design of the governance system. COBIT 2019 defines 11 design factors used to tailor the governance system to the enterprise context.

| # | Design Factor | Category | Description |
|---|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Enterprise Strategy | Strategic | Growth/acquisition, innovation, cost optimization, client service/stability |
| 2 | Enterprise Goals | Strategic | Prioritized goals derived from balanced scorecard dimensions (financial, customer, internal, learning) |
| 3 | Risk Profile | Contextual | Current risk categories and risk appetite of the enterprise |
| 4 | I&T-Related Issues | Contextual | Current pain points and trigger events related to I&T |
| 5 | Threat Landscape | Contextual | The level and type of threats the enterprise is exposed to |
| 6 | Compliance Requirements | Contextual | Regulatory and contractual compliance obligations |
| 7 | Role of IT | Strategic | Whether IT is support, factory, turnaround, or strategic (McFarlan matrix) |
| 8 | Sourcing Model | Tactical | Outsourcing, cloud, insourcing, hybrid approaches |
| 9 | IT Implementation Methods | Tactical | Agile, DevOps, traditional/waterfall, bimodal |
| 10 | Technology Adoption Strategy | Tactical | First mover, follower, slow adopter |
| 11 | Enterprise Size | Contextual | Large enterprise, SME, small enterprise |

**Design workflow**: Assess each factor, determine its impact on governance priorities, adjust the importance and target capability levels of the 40 objectives, then customize governance components accordingly.

## Focus Areas

Focus areas are specific governance topics that can be addressed by a collection of governance and management objectives at specific target capability levels. ISACA publishes guidance for the following focus areas:

| Focus Area | Key Objectives Involved | Description |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Small and Medium Enterprises** | Tailored subset of all 40 | Scaled governance for resource-constrained organizations |
| **Cybersecurity** | APO12, APO13, DSS05, BAI06, MEA01-03 | Information security risk and controls alignment |

| **DevOps** | BAI01, BAI03, BAI06, BAI07, APO04 | Governance of agile and continuous delivery practices |
| **Digital Transformation** | APO02, APO04, BAI05, APO08 | Governing digital business strategy and change |
| **Privacy** | APO01, APO14, DSS06, MEA03 | GDPR and data privacy regulation compliance |
| **Risk Management** | EDM03, APO12, MEA03 | Enterprise risk governance and management |

## COBIT Components (Governance System Components)

Each governance/management objective is supported by seven types of components (formerly called "enablers" in COBIT 5):

| # | Component | Description | Example Artifacts |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Processes** | Organized sets of practices and activities to achieve objectives | Process descriptions, input/output tables, RACI charts |
| 2 | **Organizational Structures** | Decision-making entities within the enterprise | IT steering committee, CISO office, architecture board |
| 3 | **Information Flows and Items** | Information required for the governance system to function | Policies, plans, reports, risk registers, audit findings |
| 4 | **People, Skills and Competencies** | Skills required and linked to specific roles | Security analyst competencies, board-level IT literacy |
| 5 | **Policies and Procedures** | Translate desired behavior into practical guidance for day-to-day management | IT security policy, acceptable use policy, change management procedure |
| 6 | **Culture, Ethics and Behavior** | Individual and organizational behavioral patterns | Risk-aware culture, ethical decision-making, compliance mindset |
| 7 | **Services, Infrastructure and Applications** | Technology and services that support governance | GRC platforms, ITSM tools, monitoring infrastructure |

## RACI Charts

Each governance/management objective includes a RACI chart that defines responsibilities for its practices. RACI stands for:

| Role | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **R** — Responsible | The person or role that performs the work to complete the activity |
| **A** — Accountable | The person or role that has final authority and accountability for the activity (only one per activity) |
| **C** — Consulted | Persons or roles whose input is sought (two-way communication) |
| **I** — Informed | Persons or roles who are kept up-to-date on progress and results (one-way communication) |

**Key organizational structures referenced in COBIT RACI charts**:
- Board of Directors
- Executive Committee
- Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- Chief Information Officer (CIO)
- Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

## COBIT and Information Security — ISO 27001 Alignment

COBIT 2019 aligns with ISO 27001:2022 through multiple governance and management objectives. The following mapping provides the primary alignment points:

| COBIT 2019 Objective | ISO 27001:2022 Alignment |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| APO12 (Managed Risk) | Clause 6.1 — Actions to address risks and opportunities |
| APO13 (Managed Security) | Clause 6.1.2, 6.1.3 — Information security risk assessment and treatment |
| APO14 (Managed Data) | Annex A 5.33 — Protection of records; A 5.34 — Privacy and PII protection |
| BAI06 (Managed IT Changes) | Annex A 8.32 — Change management |
| BAI09 (Managed Assets) | Annex A 5.9-5.14 — Asset management controls |
| BAI10 (Managed Configuration) | Annex A 8.9 — Configuration management |
| DSS01 (Managed Operations) | Annex A 8.14 — Redundancy of information processing facilities |
| DSS02 (Managed Service Requests and Incidents) | Annex A 5.24-5.28 — Incident management controls |
| DSS04 (Managed Continuity) | Annex A 5.29, 5.30 — ICT readiness for business continuity |
| DSS05 (Managed Security Services) | Annex A 8.1-8.34 — Technology controls |
| DSS06 (Managed Business Process Controls) | Annex A 5.2, 5.3, 5.10 — Policy and access management |
| MEA01 (Managed Performance and Conformance Monitoring) | Clause 9 — Performance evaluation |
| MEA02 (Managed System of Internal Control) | Clause 9.2, 9.3 — Internal audit and management review |
| MEA03 (Managed Compliance with External Requirements) | Annex A 5.31, 5.36 — Compliance with legal and policy requirements |
| MEA04 (Managed Assurance) | Clause 9.2 — Internal audit; Clause 10 — Improvement |

**Usage note**: COBIT provides the governance wrapper while ISO 27001 provides the information security management system (ISMS). Organizations frequently implement both, using COBIT for enterprise-wide I&T governance and ISO 27001 for the security management system within that governance structure.

## Implementation Approach

COBIT 2019 provides an implementation lifecycle based on continual improvement:

1. **What are the drivers?** — Identify pain points, trigger events, regulatory pressure
2. **Where are we now?** — Assess current capability levels across the 40 objectives
3. **Where do we want to be?** — Set target capability levels based on design factors
4. **What needs to be done?** — Identify gaps between current and target states
5. **How do we get there?** — Define improvement projects and initiatives
6. **Did we get there?** — Measure results and verify improvement
7. **How do we keep the momentum going?** — Embed changes and iterate
