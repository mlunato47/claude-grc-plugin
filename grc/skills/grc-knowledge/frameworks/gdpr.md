# GDPR — EU General Data Protection Regulation

**Full Title**: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council
**Adopted**: April 27, 2016
**Effective**: May 25, 2018
**Scope**: Processing of personal data of individuals in the EU/EEA, regardless of where the processing organization is established
**Authority**: European Data Protection Board (EDPB), national Supervisory Authorities (SAs)
**Structure**: 99 articles across 11 chapters, 173 recitals

## Overview

The GDPR is the primary data protection law governing the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personal data relating to individuals in the European Union and European Economic Area. It applies to any organization worldwide that processes personal data of EU/EEA residents, establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction (Art. 3). The regulation harmonized data protection rules across EU member states, replacing the 1995 Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).

**Key definitions (Art. 4)**:
- **Personal data** — Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject")
- **Processing** — Any operation performed on personal data (collection, recording, storage, retrieval, use, disclosure, erasure)
- **Controller** — Entity that determines the purposes and means of processing
- **Processor** — Entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller
- **Supervisory Authority (SA)** — Independent public authority responsible for monitoring GDPR application in a member state

## Seven Principles of Processing (Article 5)

| # | Principle | Article | Description |
|---|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency** | Art. 5(1)(a) | Data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject |
| 2 | **Purpose Limitation** | Art. 5(1)(b) | Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes |
| 3 | **Data Minimisation** | Art. 5(1)(c) | Data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed |
| 4 | **Accuracy** | Art. 5(1)(d) | Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; inaccurate data must be erased or rectified without delay |
| 5 | **Storage Limitation** | Art. 5(1)(e) | Data must be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the processing purposes |
| 6 | **Integrity and Confidentiality** | Art. 5(1)(f) | Data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage |
| 7 | **Accountability** | Art. 5(2) | The controller must be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with all of the above principles |

## Six Lawful Bases for Processing (Article 6)

| Lawful Basis | Article | Description | Key Considerations |
|--------------|---------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Consent** | Art. 6(1)(a) | Data subject has given clear, affirmative consent for one or more specific purposes | Must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous (Art. 7). Withdrawable at any time. Cannot be bundled with T&Cs. |
| **Contract** | Art. 6(1)(b) | Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject, or to take pre-contractual steps at their request | Limited to processing genuinely necessary for the contract, not merely useful |
| **Legal Obligation** | Art. 6(1)(c) | Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject | Must be based on EU or member state law; controller cannot choose this basis voluntarily |
| **Vital Interests** | Art. 6(1)(d) | Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person | Narrow scope — generally limited to life-or-death situations |
| **Public Task** | Art. 6(1)(e) | Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority | Primarily for public authorities; requires a basis in EU or member state law |
| **Legitimate Interests** | Art. 6(1)(f) | Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, except where overridden by the data subject's interests or fundamental rights | Requires a three-part test (legitimate interest, necessity, balancing). Not available to public authorities for core tasks. |

- Large-scale processing of special category data (Art. 9) or criminal conviction data (Art. 10)
- Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale

**DPIA must contain** (Art. 35(7)):
1. Systematic description of processing operations and purposes, including legitimate interest if applicable
2. Assessment of necessity and proportionality in relation to the purposes
3. Assessment of risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms
4. Measures to address risks, including safeguards, security measures, and mechanisms to demonstrate compliance

**Prior consultation (Art. 36)**: If the DPIA indicates high residual risk that cannot be sufficiently mitigated, the controller must consult the SA before processing begins. The SA has up to 8 weeks to respond (extendable by 6 weeks).

## Penalty Tiers (Article 83)

| Tier | Maximum Fine | Applicable Violations |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Up to **EUR 10,000,000** or **2%** of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher | Art. 8 (child's consent), Art. 11 (processing not requiring identification), Art. 25-39 (controller/processor obligations, DPO), Art. 42-43 (certification) |
| **Tier 2** | Up to **EUR 20,000,000** or **4%** of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher | Art. 5 (principles), Art. 6 (lawful bases), Art. 7 (consent conditions), Art. 9 (special categories), Art. 12-22 (data subject rights), Art. 44-49 (international transfers), non-compliance with SA orders |

**Factors considered when determining fines (Art. 83(2))**:
- Nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement
- Intentional or negligent character
- Actions taken to mitigate damage
- Degree of responsibility (technical and organizational measures in place)
- Previous infringements
- Degree of cooperation with the SA
- Categories of personal data affected
- How the infringement became known to the SA (self-reported vs. complaint)
- Adherence to approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms

---

## Supervisory Authority Role (Art. 51-76)

Each EU/EEA member state establishes one or more independent Supervisory Authorities (SAs) to monitor and enforce the GDPR.

**Key powers**:
- **Investigative** (Art. 58(1)): Order the controller/processor to provide information, carry out audits, obtain access to premises
- **Corrective** (Art. 58(2)): Issue warnings, reprimands, orders to comply, impose processing bans, order data erasure, impose administrative fines
- **Advisory** (Art. 58(3)): Issue opinions, approve BCRs, accredit certification bodies

**One-Stop-Shop mechanism (Art. 56)**: For cross-border processing, the SA of the controller's main establishment acts as the Lead Supervisory Authority, coordinating with Concerned SAs. Disputes are resolved by the EDPB through the consistency mechanism (Art. 63-65).

**Notable SAs**: CNIL (France), BfDI (Germany — federal), ICO (UK, post-Brexit under UK GDPR), DPC (Ireland — lead SA for many US tech companies with EU headquarters), AEPD (Spain), Garante (Italy), AP (Netherlands).

## Relationship to ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC)

The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) complements the GDPR as *lex specialis* for the electronic communications sector:

| Aspect | GDPR | ePrivacy Directive |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Scope** | All personal data processing | Electronic communications: cookies, direct marketing, traffic/location data, confidentiality of communications |
| **Cookies & tracking** | Provides lawful basis framework | Requires informed consent for non-essential cookies (Art. 5(3) ePD) |
| **Direct marketing** | Right to object (Art. 21(2)-(3)) | Opt-in required for electronic marketing (Art. 13 ePD), with soft opt-in exception for existing customers |
| **Relationship** | General law (*lex generalis*) | Specific law (*lex specialis*) — prevails where it applies |
| **Enforcement** | SA enforcement under Art. 83 fines | Varies by member state transposition; GDPR fines may apply where ePD provisions concern personal data |

The proposed ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) is intended to replace the ePD and align it with the GDPR, but as of 2025 has not been finalized.
