# ISO 27001:2022 & ISO 27002:2022 Reference

## Overview

**ISO/IEC 27001:2022** is the international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It is the certification standard — organizations undergo independent audits by accredited Certification Bodies (CBs) to achieve ISO 27001 certification. ISO 27001 specifies mandatory ISMS requirements (Clauses 4-10) and a normative reference set of controls (Annex A).

**ISO/IEC 27002:2022** is the companion implementation guidance standard. It is not a certification standard. It provides detailed guidance on selecting, implementing, and managing the controls referenced in ISO 27001 Annex A. ISO 27002 expands each control with purpose statements, guidance, and supplementary information that ISO 27001 does not include.

## Statement of Applicability (SoA)

The SoA is a mandatory document (Clause 6.1.3) and a core audit artifact bridging risk treatment decisions and control selection. For each of the 93 Annex A controls, the SoA must document: whether the control is applicable (Yes/No), justification for inclusion or exclusion, implementation status (implemented / partially implemented / planned / not implemented), and a description of how the control is implemented (referencing policies, procedures, or tools).

Auditors scrutinize exclusions. Any Annex A control may be excluded, but the organization must demonstrate that the exclusion does not compromise information security as determined by risk assessment. Common exclusions include A.7.x physical controls for fully remote organizations, but each must be individually justified.

## Risk Assessment and Treatment Process

### Risk Assessment (Clause 6.1.2 / Clause 8.2)

1. **Establish context** — Define risk criteria (likelihood scale, impact scale, risk acceptance threshold), scope, and methodology.
2. **Risk identification** — Identify assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and existing controls. Determine risks to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
3. **Risk analysis** — Assess likelihood and consequence for each risk. Calculate risk level using the defined methodology (qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative).
4. **Risk evaluation** — Compare risk levels against acceptance criteria. Prioritize risks for treatment.

### Risk Treatment (Clause 6.1.3 / Clause 8.3)

| Treatment Option | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Modify (mitigate) | Apply controls to reduce risk to acceptable level |
| Retain (accept) | Accept the risk with documented approval from risk owner |
| Avoid | Eliminate the activity or condition causing the risk |
| Share (transfer) | Transfer risk through insurance, outsourcing, or contracts |

The risk treatment plan must identify selected controls, responsible owners, implementation timelines, and required resources. Residual risk must be formally accepted by risk owners.

## ISO 27002:2022 Attribute Taxonomy

ISO 27002:2022 introduced five attribute types assigned to each control. These enable filtering, sorting, and presenting controls from different perspectives.

### Control Types

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Preventive | Control acts to prevent an incident from occurring |
| Detective | Control acts to detect an incident when it occurs |
| Corrective | Control acts to correct impact after an incident occurs |

### Information Security Properties (CIA)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Confidentiality | Control protects against unauthorized disclosure |
| Integrity | Control protects against unauthorized modification |
| Availability | Control protects against disruption of access |

### Cybersecurity Concepts (NIST CSF alignment)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Identify | Asset management, risk assessment, governance |
| Protect | Access control, awareness, data security, protective technology |
| Detect | Anomalies, events, continuous monitoring |
| Respond | Response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation |
| Recover | Recovery planning, improvements, communications |

### Operational Capabilities

Controls are tagged with one or more of the following 15 operational capabilities:

Governance, Asset management, Information protection, Human resource security, Physical security, System and network security, Application security, Secure configuration, Identity and access management, Threat and vulnerability management, Continuity, Supplier relationships security, Legal and compliance, Information security event management, Information security assurance.

### Security Domains

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Governance and ecosystem | Governance, risk management, ecosystem security |
| Protection | Logical and physical protection measures |
| Defence | Detection, incident management, response |
| Resilience | Continuity, recovery, crisis management |

## Certification Process

### Stage 1 Audit (Documentation Review)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Assess ISMS documentation readiness and planning for Stage 2 |
| Duration | 1-2 days (typically on-site or remote) |
| Focus areas | ISMS scope, information security policy, risk assessment methodology, risk treatment plan, SoA, internal audit and management review evidence |
| Output | Stage 1 report with findings and confirmation of Stage 2 readiness |
| Gap period | Typically 1-3 months between Stage 1 and Stage 2 |

### Stage 2 Audit (Certification Audit)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Evaluate ISMS implementation effectiveness and operational conformity |
| Duration | 3-10 days depending on organization size and scope |
| Focus areas | Implementation of controls, operational evidence, interviews with control owners, risk treatment effectiveness, monitoring and measurement results |
| Possible outcomes | Certification (no major NCs), conditional (major NCs require correction within 90 days), or denial |
| Nonconformity types | Major (failure to fulfill a requirement, systemic) or Minor (isolated, does not affect ISMS capability) |

### Surveillance and Recertification

**Surveillance audits** are conducted annually (Year 1 and Year 2 after initial certification). Scope is a subset of the full ISMS; auditors sample different controls each cycle and must cover Clauses 4-10 core processes across the surveillance cycle. Major nonconformities may result in suspension of certification.

**Recertification** occurs in Year 3 before the 3-year certificate expires. It is a full scope reassessment similar to Stage 2, initiating a new 3-year cycle upon successful completion.

```
Year 0: Stage 1 + Stage 2 --> Initial certification (3-year validity)
Year 1: Surveillance audit 1
Year 2: Surveillance audit 2
Year 3: Recertification audit --> New 3-year cycle begins
```

## Mandatory Documented Information

ISO 27001:2022 explicitly requires documented information for: ISMS scope (4.3), information security policy (5.2), risk assessment process and results (6.1.2, 8.2), risk treatment process, SoA, and risk treatment plan (6.1.3, 8.3), information security objectives (6.2), evidence of competence (7.2), monitoring and measurement results (9.1), internal audit program and results (9.2), management review results (9.3), and nonconformities and corrective action results (10.2).

## Common Audit Findings

| Finding Category | Typical Nonconformity |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Risk assessment | Methodology not consistently applied; risk register not updated after changes |
| SoA | Exclusions not justified; SoA not aligned with current risk treatment plan |
| Internal audit | Program not covering full ISMS scope; lack of auditor independence |
| Management review | Missing required inputs; no evidence of decisions or actions from reviews |
| Documented information | Policies not reviewed on schedule; version control gaps; missing approvals |
| Competence | No training records; roles and responsibilities not clearly defined |
| Monitoring | KPIs/metrics not defined or not measured; no trend analysis |
| Corrective action | Root cause analysis not performed; effectiveness not verified |
