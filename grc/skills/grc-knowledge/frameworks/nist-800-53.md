# NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 — Security and Privacy Controls

## Overview

**Full title**: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations
**Publication**: NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 5 (September 2020; Update 1 released December 2020)
**Authority**: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), under FISMA (Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014)
**Applicability**: All federal information systems (mandatory); widely adopted by private sector, DoD, and state/local governments
**Companion documents**:
- **SP 800-53A Rev 5** — Assessment procedures for each control
- **SP 800-53B** — Control baselines (Low, Moderate, High, Privacy)
- **SP 800-37 Rev 2** — Risk Management Framework (RMF) lifecycle
- **FIPS 199** — Standards for security categorization
- **FIPS 200** — Minimum security requirements

**Purpose**: Provides a catalog of security and privacy controls that organizations select and tailor to protect information systems and the privacy of individuals. It is framework-agnostic — controls describe *what* to achieve, not *how* to implement.

**Total catalog**: ~1,189 controls and control enhancements across 20 control families.

## Control Structure

Each control in the catalog follows a consistent structure:

```
AC-2  ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT                     ← Control ID + Title
  Control:                                    ← Base control statement
    a. Define and document the types of accounts...
    b. Assign account managers...
    ...
  Discussion:                                 ← Supplemental guidance
  Related Controls: AC-3, AC-5, IA-2...       ← Cross-references
  Control Enhancements:
    AC-2(1) AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  ← Enhancement ID + Title
    AC-2(2) AUTOMATED TEMPORARY AND EMERGENCY ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
    ...
  References: [SP 800-63-3], [OMB A-130]      ← Source documents
```

### Key structural elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Base control** | The primary control statement with lettered sub-items (a, b, c...) |
| **Control enhancements** | Numbered extensions (e.g., AC-2(1), AC-2(2)) that add specificity or rigor; selected independently based on baseline or tailoring |
| **Organization-defined parameters (ODPs)** | Brackets `[Assignment: organization-defined ...]` or `[Selection: ...]` that require the organization to fill in values |
| **Discussion** | Supplemental guidance explaining intent and context |
| **Related controls** | Cross-references to other controls in the catalog |
| **References** | External standards, policies, or publications |

### Parameter types

- **Assignment**: Organization provides a specific value (e.g., `[Assignment: frequency]` → "at least annually")
- **Selection**: Organization picks from a provided list (e.g., `[Selection: locks account; delays next logon]`)
- **Assignment within Selection**: Nested parameters requiring both a choice and a value

## Baseline Allocations (SP 800-53B)

Baselines are predefined sets of controls corresponding to FIPS 199 impact levels. Organizations select a baseline and then tailor it to their specific risk environment.

| Baseline | Total Controls (incl. enhancements) | Applicable Families | Usage |
|----------|:---:|:---:|-------|
| **Low** | ~150 | 18 of 20 | Systems where loss of C/I/A has limited adverse effect |
| **Moderate** | ~304 | 18 of 20 | Systems where loss has serious adverse effect; most common federal baseline |
| **High** | ~392 | 18 of 20 | Systems where loss has severe or catastrophic adverse effect |
| **Privacy** | Separate baseline | Varies | Applied to systems processing PII regardless of impact level |

**Families with special baseline allocation**: PM (Program Management) controls are organization-wide and selected independently, not allocated to security baselines. PT (PII Processing and Transparency) controls are primarily allocated to the privacy baseline; however, PT-1 through PT-6 may also appear in security baselines per SP 800-53B when PII is processed. Always check the current 800-53B for authoritative baseline assignments.

### Baseline progression

The baselines are cumulative — Moderate includes everything in Low plus additional controls, and High includes everything in Moderate plus additional controls:

- **Low → Moderate** adds: AC-4, AC-5, AC-6 and enhancements, AC-11, AC-12, AC-17 enhancements, AC-21, AU enhancements for content/centralization, CM-5, CM-9, CP enhancements for alternate sites and recovery, IA enhancements for MFA and re-authentication, IR-6(1), SC-7 enhancements, SI-4 enhancements, and many others (~154 additions).
- **Moderate → High** adds: AC-3 enhancements (mandatory access control), AU-10 (non-repudiation), CP-6/CP-7 enhancements, PE enhancements (facility penetration testing), SC-3 (security function isolation), SC-24 (fail to known state), SI-6 (security/privacy function verification), and others (~88 additions).

## Control Designations

Organizations categorize each control implementation as one of three types:

| Designation | Definition | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Common** | Inheritable control implemented once at the organizational or shared-services level; protects multiple systems | PE-2 (Physical Access Authorizations) provided by a shared data center |
| **System-Specific** | Implemented by and for a single system; not shared | AC-6 enforcement within a specific application |
| **Hybrid** | Partially common, partially system-specific; the common portion is inherited and the remainder is implemented at the system level | IR-1: organization provides the policy (common), each system documents its own procedures (system-specific) |

**When to inherit**: Examine ODPs — if a common control's parameter values satisfy the inheriting system's requirements, full inheritance is valid. If the system needs different parameter values, it becomes hybrid.

**Documentation requirement**: The SSP must clearly state for each control whether it is common (inherited), system-specific, or hybrid, and identify the provider of any inherited portion.

## Revision 4 to Revision 5 Changes

Rev 5 was published September 23, 2020, replacing Rev 4 (January 2015). Key changes:

### Structural changes

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Two new families** | PT (PII Processing and Transparency) and SR (Supply Chain Risk Management) added |
| **PM family expanded** | Program Management grew from 16 to 32 base controls |
| **Privacy integration** | Appendix J privacy controls (Rev 4) were dissolved; privacy controls integrated throughout the catalog and into PT family |
| **Outcome-based language** | Controls rewritten to state desired outcome rather than entity responsible (e.g., "the system does X" vs. "the organization configures the system to do X") |
| **Baselines separated** | Baselines moved from Appendix D to standalone publication SP 800-53B |
| **Control entity removed** | Rev 4 specified responsible entities in the control text; Rev 5 removes this, leaving it to implementation |

### Control catalog changes

| Metric | Rev 4 | Rev 5 | Delta |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Control families | 18 | 20 | +2 (PT, SR) |
| Base controls | ~256 | ~322 | +66 new base controls |
| Control enhancements | ~655 | ~867 | +212 new enhancements |
| Withdrawn controls | — | 90 | 90 controls withdrawn from Rev 4 and incorporated elsewhere |

### Notable withdrawn controls (incorporated into other controls)

| Withdrawn Control | Incorporated Into | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| SC-19 (VoIP) | SC-7 (Boundary Protection) | VoIP treated as boundary concern |
| SA-18 (Tamper Resistance) | SR-9 (Tamper Resistance and Detection) | Moved to new SR family |
| SA-19 (Component Authenticity) | SR-11 (Component Authenticity) | Moved to new SR family |
| SA-12 (Supply Chain Protection) | SR-1 through SR-12 | Decomposed across SR family |
| AC-13 (Supervision and Review) | AC-2, AU-6 | Distributed to relevant families |
| SC-34(3) (Non-Modifiable Executables enhancement) | SC-51 | Enhancement moved to new control; SC-34 base control still exists in Rev 5 |

## FedRAMP Parameter Values — Critical Controls

FedRAMP defines specific values for organization-defined parameters (ODPs) that CSPs must use. These override any broader organizational values.

| Control | Parameter | FedRAMP Value (Moderate) |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| AC-1 | Policy review frequency | At least every 3 years |
| AC-1 | Procedure review frequency | At least annually |
| AC-2(j) | Account review frequency | At least annually |
| AC-2 | Disable inactive accounts | 90 days of inactivity |
| AC-2(3) | Auto-disable of inactive accounts | 35 days of inactivity |
| AC-7(a) | Max consecutive failed logons | Not more than three (3) consecutive invalid attempts |
| AC-7(a) | Time period for counting attempts | During a 15-minute period |
| AC-7(b) | Account lockout action | Locks the account/node for a minimum of 30 minutes or until released by administrator |
| AC-11(a) | Session lock inactivity period | 15 minutes |
| AU-6(a) | Audit review frequency | At least weekly |
| AU-11 | Audit retention | At least 12 months online, 18 months total (online + offline/archive); agency-specific requirements may mandate longer retention |
| CM-6 | Configuration settings source | DISA STIGs (preferred); CIS Benchmarks (where STIGs unavailable); vendor hardening guides |
| IA-5(1)(a) | Password minimum length | Minimum of 12 characters; at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 numeric, 1 special character |
| IA-5(1)(b) | Changed characters on password renewal | At least one (1) character |
| IA-5(1)(d) | Password minimum lifetime | 1 day |
| IA-5(1)(d) | Password maximum lifetime | 60 days |

> **Note on IA-5(1) and NIST SP 800-63B**: NIST 800-53 Rev 5 aligns IA-5(1) with SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, which recommend against mandatory complexity composition rules and periodic rotation when MFA is in place. However, FedRAMP Rev 5 baselines retain prescriptive password parameters (complexity, 60-day rotation, 24-password history) as listed above. CSPs must follow FedRAMP's published parameter values regardless of the 800-63B direction.
| RA-5(a) | Vulnerability scanning frequency | At least monthly (OS, web app, database, container) |
| SC-7(5) | Default traffic policy | Deny by default; allow by exception |
| SI-2 | Flaw remediation timeframes | Critical: 30 days; High: 30 days; Moderate: 90 days; Low: 180 days |
| SI-4(5) | Alert recipients for system-generated alerts | ISSO; ISSM; and defined personnel |

> **Note**: FedRAMP parameter values are defined in the FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline and may be updated independently of NIST baselines. Always check the current FedRAMP baseline for the authoritative values.

---

## Tailoring the Baseline

After selecting a baseline (Low, Moderate, High), organizations tailor it through these activities (per SP 800-53B, Section 2):

1. **Identifying common controls** — Determine which controls are provided by the organization, shared infrastructure, or external providers
2. **Applying scoping considerations** — Remove controls not applicable to the technology or environment (e.g., removing wireless controls if wireless is prohibited)
3. **Selecting compensating controls** — Substitute equivalent controls when a baseline control cannot be implemented as written
4. **Assigning parameter values** — Fill in all ODPs per organizational or FedRAMP requirements
5. **Supplementing the baseline** — Add controls beyond the baseline based on risk assessment, threat intelligence, or regulatory requirements
6. **Providing specification information** — Document the rationale for all tailoring decisions

**Tailoring documentation**: All tailoring decisions must be documented in the SSP and approved by the Authorizing Official (AO).

---

## OSCAL Representation

NIST maintains machine-readable versions of SP 800-53 and 800-53B in OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) format:

- **Catalog** (JSON/XML/YAML): Full control catalog with all parameters, enhancements, and metadata
- **Profiles** (JSON/XML/YAML): Baseline selections with parameter settings (Low, Moderate, High)
- **SSP models**: Structured format for documenting control implementations

OSCAL files are published at: `https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content`

These machine-readable formats enable automated compliance workflows, GRC tool ingestion, and programmatic baseline comparison.

## Cross-Framework Role

NIST 800-53 serves as the **anchor framework** for cross-framework control mapping. Its comprehensive catalog and granular control structure make it the industry-standard Rosetta Stone:

| Mapping Direction | Relationship | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| NIST 800-53 → FedRAMP | Superset → Profile | FedRAMP baselines are NIST baselines with FedRAMP-specific parameters and additional requirements |
| NIST 800-53 → CMMC / 800-171 | Parent → Derived | NIST 800-171 CUI controls are derived from the NIST 800-53 Moderate baseline |
| NIST 800-53 → SOC 2 | Granular → Aggregated | Multiple 800-53 controls map to each SOC 2 Trust Services Criterion |
| NIST 800-53 → ISO 27001 | Catalog → Annex A | NIST controls map to ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls, often many-to-one |
| NIST 800-53 → CSF 2.0 | Detailed → Categorical | CSF subcategories reference 800-53 controls as informative references |
| NIST 800-53 → PCI DSS | Federal → Industry | Mappable but different intent; PCI is prescriptive, NIST is risk-based |
| NIST 800-53 → CIS Controls | Comprehensive → Prioritized | CIS safeguards map to subsets of 800-53 controls, organized by implementation priority |

**Mapping strategy**: To map between any two non-NIST frameworks, map each to NIST 800-53 first, then correlate. This reduces N-by-N mapping complexity to N-by-2.
